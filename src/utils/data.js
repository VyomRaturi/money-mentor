  question: "What is the first step in financial planning?",
  answer: "The very first step in the financial planning process is to take a deep dive into your finances. This includes reviewing your monthly income, outstanding debts, bank account balances, and monthly fixed expenses. In the case of a certified financial planner (CFP), they would ask the client questions about the client’s health, values, earnings potential, risk tolerance, needs, and more. By addressing all aspects of your financial lifestyle, you’ll be better equipped to determine what needs to change, and how to improve your financial situation."

  question: "What are the seven steps of financial planning?",

  question: "How might taxes have an impact on your financial plan?",
  answer: "It’s important to consider taxes when creating a financial plan. Depending on your individual circumstances, such as age and income, taxes can have an impact. Say saving for retirement is a main goal for you, and your place of employment offers a 401(k) plan. By choosing to enroll in the plan you will have a pathway to meet your goal, and tax advantages may be able to get you there even quicker. Also, when considering your net worth as part of the financial plan, a liability to factor in may be income taxes or taxes due on the profits of your investments."
